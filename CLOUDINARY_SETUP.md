# Cloudinary Setup & Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Set Up Cloudinary Account

1. **Create Account** (if you don't have one)
   - Go to https://cloudinary.com/
   - Sign up for free (includes 25GB storage & 25GB bandwidth/month)

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Login to https://console.cloudinary.com/
   - Find your **Cloud Name** on the dashboard
   - Copy it for later use

## Step 2: Upload Background Images to Cloudinary

### Option A: Using Cloudinary Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Login to Cloudinary Console**
   - Go to https://console.cloudinary.com/

2. **Upload Images:**
   - Click "Media Library" in left sidebar
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Upload these files from `public/background/`:
     - `home-background.png`
     - `about-background.png`
     - `projects-background.png`
     - `contact-background.png`

3. **Create a folder structure:**
   - Create folder: `portfolio/backgrounds/`
   - Upload all background images there

4. **Note the URLs:**
   After uploading, your images will have URLs like:
   ```
   https://res.cloudinary.com/{your-cloud-name}/image/upload/v1234567890/portfolio/backgrounds/home-background.png
   ```

### Option B: Using Cloudinary Upload Widget (Alternative)

You can also use their web interface to drag and drop images directly.

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in your project root:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
   ```

2. **Replace `your_cloud_name_here`** with your actual Cloudinary cloud name

## Step 4: Update Image Paths (Already Configured!)

The Next.js config is already set up to support Cloudinary. Just update your image URLs to use Cloudinary.

Example format:
```javascript
const cloudinaryUrl = `https://res.cloudinary.com/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME}/image/upload/`;
```

## Alternative: Keep Local Images for Now

If you want to deploy quickly without Cloudinary setup, you can:
1. Keep the local images (they're already optimized by Next.js)
2. Deploy to Vercel as-is
3. Add Cloudinary later for additional optimization

Next.js already has built-in image optimization that works great with Vercel!

# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Your code pushed to GitHub repository

## Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

1. **Ensure `.gitignore` includes:**
   ```
   .env.local
   .env*.local
   .next
   node_modules
   ```

2. **Check if you have a git repository:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. **If not initialized, initialize git:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Dr. Memon's AI Galaxy Portfolio"
   ```

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `dr-memon-portfolio` (or your choice)
   - Keep it Public or Private
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have files)

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dr-memon-portfolio.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel:**
   - Visit https://vercel.com/
   - Click "Sign Up" or "Login" (use GitHub for easiest setup)

2. **Import Project:**
   - Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings

3. **Configure Environment Variables (if using Cloudinary):**
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` with your cloud name
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - Vercel will build and deploy (takes 2-3 minutes)
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://dr-memon-portfolio.vercel.app`

### Option B: Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# For production
vercel --prod
```

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project
   - Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain (e.g., `mlmemon.com`)

2. **Update DNS:**
   - Add CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - Or use Vercel nameservers

## Performance Optimizations Already Applied

âœ… Next.js Image Optimization
âœ… Static Generation for fast loading
âœ… Optimized bundle size
âœ… Lazy loading for 3D models
âœ… Code splitting
âœ… Galaxy theme with optimized star particles

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Test all pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
- [ ] Verify 3D models load correctly
- [ ] Check all links work (GitHub, LinkedIn, Scholar)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify star particle effects work
- [ ] Check page load speed with Lighthouse

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors:
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Run `npm run build` locally to test first
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`

### Environment Variables:
- Make sure Cloudinary env var starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Redeploy after adding env vars

### 3D Models Not Loading:
- Ensure GLB files are in `public/models/`
- Check file paths are correct
- Verify files aren't too large (keep under 5MB each)

## Quick Deploy Command

```bash
# Build locally to test
npm run build

# If successful, commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push

# Vercel will auto-deploy on push (if connected)
```

Your site will be live at your Vercel URL! ðŸš€
